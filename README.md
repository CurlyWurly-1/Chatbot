# Chatbot
Speech recognition feeding GPT-3, with the response being spoken back.

These programs were written for python3 - you will have to install some modules. 
There are 2 main programs:
 - The Jetson Nano version called "jetson_nano_chatbot.py" will execute "speak.py" for speech output
 - The WIN10 version called "WIN10_chatbot.py" is self contained i.e. it doesn't call "speak.py"
